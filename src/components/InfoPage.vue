          <h1>The Saltee Foundation: Enabling Cultural Exchange</h1>
          
          <p>
              Saltee is a luxury suncare brand with a strong eco-friendly ethos, underpinned by a 
              passion for life-changing travel experiences, and a mission to inspire cultural exchange.

              Many brands take steps to do less harm in the world, but at Saltee, we believe that doing less 
              harm is no longer enough. From the outset, we’ve been committed to minimising our environmental 
              impact and promoting responsible travel – but now, we’re taking things one step further.<br><br>

              Sam, Patrick, and the rest of the Saltee team are proud to introduce the Saltee Foundation – 
              a charitable trust created to promote cultural awareness and foster a better understanding of 
              communities and environments outside our own. The Foundation represents our commitment not only 
              to do less harm, but to ensure Saltee’s presence in the world is an active force for good.
          </p>
          <p>
              The Saltee Foundation’s first projects will reflect one of our primary goals – to improve lives 
              and bring people together, by helping young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to travel, 
              study, and experience different cultures. This will include funding significant bursaries for 
              international and cultural studies. We’ll also use Saltee as a platform to promote works in 
              these fields, in a bid to increase public awareness and shape government policy on key issues 
              relating to the environment, migration, and international relations.

              Each year, a minimum of 10% of Saltee’s profits will be invested in the Saltee Foundation, and 
              we’ll be inviting our like-minded partners to make similar investment commitments. We’re 
              incredibly excited about what the future holds for the Foundation, the initiatives it will fund, 
              and the lives it will impact.
          </p>

              We strongly believe that by facilitating positive, open, cultural exchange, we can break down 
              barriers, broaden perspectives and create a more connected planet. Now with every Saltee skincare 
              purchase, you can make a meaningful contribution to this mission to improve and protect our world 
            – while also protecting your skin.
