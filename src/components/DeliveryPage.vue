              As long as the Saltee suncream has not been used, we will issue a full refund once the item has been received by us at our warehouse. Please note that the cost of return will need to be covered by the customer, as we do not offer free returns.
              Saltee cannot be held responsible for any returns that are lost in the post, and we strongly recommend using a signed for service when posting returns to us. Please ensure that all returns reach us in a saleable condition. For example, please do not affix any stickers to the packaging.
